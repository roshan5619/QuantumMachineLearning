# Quantum Data Encoding Methods

This repository provides an overview and practical examples of **quantum feature encoding methods**, which are essential for embedding classical data into quantum states. These methods are commonly used in **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** and **Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs)**.

## üìñ Methods of Encoding

### 1. Basis Encoding
Encodes classical bits directly into computational basis states.

### 2. Amplitude Encoding
Maps a normalized classical vector into the amplitudes of a quantum state.

### 3. Angle Encoding
Encodes classical data into rotation angles of quantum gates.

### 4. Phase Encoding
Uses phase shifts of quantum states to represent classical data.

### 5. Dense Angle Encoding
A variant of angle encoding where multiple data dimensions are compactly encoded into fewer qubits.

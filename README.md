# 📚 Quantum Machine Learning (QML) – Course Notes & Projects

This repository contains my notes, code snippets, and experiments from the **Quantum Machine Learning (QML)** course.  
The course explores how quantum computing connects to classical machine learning, focusing on **quantum kernel methods, variational classifiers, and neural networks** using **Qiskit Runtime primitives**.

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By completing this course, I developed the following skills:

- Explain **what QML is** and how it connects quantum to classical ML.  
- Apply **quantum vocabulary and key terms** to ML workflows.  
- Identify the **key components** of different QML workflows.  
- Distinguish between **different types of QML approaches**.  
- Implement **quantum kernel methods** and **variational quantum classifiers** using **Qiskit**.  
- Recognize where **QML is promising** (and where it’s not).  
- Adapt example problems to **custom datasets**.  
- Understand issues such as **training time, noise, and error compounding**.  
- Make **recommendations for organizational use cases** of QML.
